tinto rang nucleic acid gel stain has been specifically developed from a natural source widely used as a food additive that shows no mutagenicity and any kind of toxicity, making it the safest (safer than SYBR safe) dye for staining nucleic acids in agarose or acrylamide gels. tinto rang stain comes either as a concentrate or as a ready-to-use solution that can be used just like an ethidium bromide solution, and the detection sensitivity with tinto rang is comparable and sensitivity is better than that obtained with SYBR safe or ethidium bromide. DNA or RNA bands stained with tinto rang gel can be detected using a standard UV transilluminator, a visible-light transilluminator, or a laser-based scanner. The stain is also suitable for staining RNA in gels. Bound to nucleic acids, tinto rang stain has fluorescence excitation maxima at 280 and 491 nm, and an emission maximum at 560 nm (Figure 1)

Tinto rang gel stain from has been developed  from a natural dye (food additive) as a safest alternative to ethidium bromide, Sybr safe and other nucleic acid binding dyes. Tinto rang stains DNA and RNA in agarose or acrylamide gels. The detection sensitivity with tinto rang stain is on par with the results obtained with ethidium bromide and better than SYBR safe. The tinto rang dye can either be loaded with the DNA itself or added directly to the agarose gel before it is set or the agarose gel can be incubated for 15 minutes in a solution of the dye (0.5 ug, no dark required) diluted in TBE/TAE buffer or water.
